            This website is dedicated to a few birds that I personally love.
            There is no particular order to the list, as the love I feel for
            birds cannot be quantified.

        Harpy Eagles are so big I bet I could get one to hug me.

        Ospreys kind of remind me of Vash the Stampede from the classic anime Trigun

        I firmly believe that humanity has done a great disservice to ravens, 
        in much the same way that we have done a disservice to pigeons. People
        trained pigeons to carry letters great distances very quickly but we
        set them all free when we no longer needed them. Although people never
        truly domesticated ravens like we did pigeons, these highly intelligent
        birds are known to cooperate with wolf packs so that they can get the 
        leftovers of a fresh hunt. Ravens <em>want</em> to be our friends but we never 
        let them.
